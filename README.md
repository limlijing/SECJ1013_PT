Programming techniques are fundamental methods and principles for designing, writing, and structuring code, ranging from fundamental procedural steps and data handling to high-level paradigms like Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Functional Programming (FP), and Event-Driven Programming, all aimed at creating efficient, maintainable, and robust software through practices like DRY principles, version control (Git), and rigorous testing.
In this course, I have learn the C++ programming language.Learning basic,array,inputfile,outputfile and create a boardgame.

## Assignment 1
Before learning C++ programming, I felt that C++ was different with Java because drawing flowcharts and writing pseudocode were quite challenging for me. In this assignment, I know how to distinguish the flowcharts and pseudocode of C++ and Java.Through practicing these steps, I was able to break down complex problems into simpler and more structured processes.This assignment helped me improve my problem-solving skills and made me more confident in understanding program flow of C++.

## Assignment 2
In this assigment 2 , I have successfully build up a small calorie calculator system by using C++ program. We can fill in our gender, age ,weight and also height.After that, we just click to run the programme and we will get the Calories/ day (using Mifflin-St Jeor Equation).This assigment helped me improve my skills to solve all the challenges and more careful to check the output with my answer that I run isn't correct or not.

## Lab 1
In the lab 1,I have succesfullly learn how to draw flowchart and pseuducode.

## Assignment 3
In this assigment 3, I have successfully open a txt file and close the file by using C++ program.
